# Hackeam-Devcoders

Project Based on Healthcare.

We have two applications. One for clients and one for chemists.
The clients would upload their medicines and send on the Python server created and deployed.
The server will use algorithms to find close-by chemists registered on our network and would send them the client's priscription.
The chemists would then reply back by send the availablity of the medicines so that the client could directly visit the preffered chemist.
